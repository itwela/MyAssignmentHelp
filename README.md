In this projects you will find the front end for an Indian Assignment Help company.

I used components a lot in the development so that developers can reuse them in differernt parts of the site if needed.

In the scr/assets/resources/ file, you will find my references and wireframes for the project.

Here is a summary of what I did:

- Built wireframe for inital layout and planning
- Implimented responsiveness to as low as 320px
- Added Gsap Loading Animation
- Moved company stats to the top
- Added a moving marquee of benefits
- Built card componenets to introduce company
- Imported data for easy fixes if need be
- Rebuilt Form
- Implimented hover animations on cards.

After some great feedback, so far I have implimented these features:

- A responsive animated review component.
- Added smooth scrolling through out the site
- Imported Lottie Library to handle animations as components
- Added animations to liven up the home page
- Redesigned the row content (Mobile and Desktop Layout)
- Implimented a Hover system to boost user experience. Made it easier to digest content by sorting content based on what youre hovering over.
- Implimented Scroll based animations to content
